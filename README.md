# Lvbel C5 Lyrics Theme Analysis

  This project analyzes the lyrics of 40+ songs by **Lvbel C5**, a well-known Turkish rapper. Using Python and text analysis techniques, I explore the most common themes, frequently used words, and how his lyrical focus has shifted over the years — especially toward romance.

## Project Highlights

- **Text Cleaning** using regex and Turkish stopword filtering  
- **Word Frequency Analysis** to extract most used words  
- **Romantic Theme Trend** analyzed year-by-year  
- **Word Cloud** to visualize lyrical focus without raw counts  
- All work done in **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**

## Visualizations

- *Romantic Mentions Over Time* – A line chart showing how often Lvbel C5 uses romantic words in his songs by release year.
- *Word Cloud* – A visual summary of the most frequent words in his lyrics (after cleaning), emphasizing style and repetition.

## Key Insights

- Romantic terms like *“bebeğim”*, *“seni”*, *“canım”* have increased in recent years.
- Most frequent words include **“lvbel”**, **“bak”**, **“yeah”**, and **“atm”** — showing a blend of branding, attitude, and lifestyle references.
- Gang/violence-related words were expected but turned out to be rare compared to romantic or personal ones.

## Final Thoughts

This was a fun and insightful personal project combining music and data. Despite his street-style image, Lvbel C5 has shown a shift toward more **romantic and emotional themes** in recent years.

**Next steps could include:**
- Analyzing other artists for comparison  
- Using better Turkish sentiment models  
- Creating an interactive dashboard
